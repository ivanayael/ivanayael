## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**ivanayael/ivanayael** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with others developers
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Project Management or how to resolve problems in a team
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ivanayaelcurra@gmail.com or ivanayael@hotmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Ivana or Ivy
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't know what I am doing right now...
